# Contoso PetFriends
Just-for-Fun project based on a C# assignment in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The app is based on the general instructions but I build it from scratch.

Currently working as intended (screenshots may be added later if I have the time and not too lazy for it). All menu selection have been added (optimization may be needed).

## To-Do-List:
1. ~~Add the code to ensure the data of the animals with no ID cannot be edited~~ (done)
2. ~~Add code number for each column (each data e.g. pet's ID, pet's nickname, etc.) in ourAnimals array~~ (done)
3. ~~Change to methods PadLeft() or PadRight() for output formatting~~ (done)
4. ~~Modify menu selection 7 & 8 to enable search for~~ ~~physical description~~ (done), ~~personality~~, (done) ~~or combined physical and personality description~~ (scraped for now because this might need AI)
5. ~~Modify menu selection 7 & 8 to enable search with multiple keywords (comma-separated)~~ (done)
6. ~~Add loading animation for menu selection 7 & 8~~ (done)
7. ~~Modify menu selection 7 & 8 to highlight the keyword that appeared in the animal's description~~ (done)
8. ~~Refactor everything~~ (done, possible future changes/addition)
9. Add loop to the task chosen (menu selection 2, 5, 6, 7, 8) instead of exiting immediately
