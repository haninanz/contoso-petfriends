# Contoso PetFriends
Just-for-Fun project based on a C# assignment in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The app is based on the general instructions but I build it from scratch.

Currently working as intended (screenshots may be added later if I have the time and not too lazy for it). All menu selection have been added (optimization may be needed).

## To-Do-List:
1. ~~Add the code to ensure the data of the animals with no ID cannot be edited~~ (done)
2. ~~Add code number for each column (each data e.g. pet's ID, pet's nickname, etc.) in ourAnimals array~~ (done)
3. Change to methods PadLeft() or PadRight() for output formatting
4. Modify menu selection 7 & 8 to enable search for ~~physical description~~ (done), personality, or ~~combined physical and personality description~~ (scraped for now because this might need AI)
