# Contoso PetFriends
Just-for-Fun project based on a C# assignment in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The app is based on the general instructions but I build it from scratch.

Currently working as intended (screenshots may be added later if I have the time and not too lazy for it). Menu selection no. 7 and 8 are still WIP. 

## To-Do-List:
1. Add the code to ensure the data of the animals with no ID cannot be edited
2. Add code number for each column (each data e.g. pet's ID, pet's nickname, etc.) in ourAnimals array
3. Change to methods PadLeft() or PadRight() for output formatting
